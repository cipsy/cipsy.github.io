	   			 	<dt>Arrangement</dt>
				    	<dd>For monthly collaboration. Under this collaboration understanding, I will provide you legal services on low complexity matters, occurring in the company’s day-to-day business. The legal assistance consists in telephone advice on specific issues, followed by brief e-mail responses. nfirming the verbal advice, or directly in e-mail responses, depending on the business specific needs. Not within the scope of help-desk services will be assistance with review and drafting of contracts, contract negotiations, legal opinions, assistance in court, drafting of due diligence reports, as well as advice and assistance on high complexity issues (which, for example, exceed 3 hours of the attorney’s time to respond/handle).
</dd>
				    <br>
				    
				    <dd>For the help-desk arrangement, I propose a <span class="span_style">monthly subscription fee</span>, computed based on the number of hours allocated monthly, multiplied by the standard hourly rate. If the monthly time spent exceeds the allocated hours for the month, unless otherwise agreed, I will invoice any additional work based on an hourly rate agreed beforehand.
</dd>
				    <br>

				    <dd>The fees are out of VAT and out-of-pocket expenses (travel, accommodation, administrative fees, etc.) that will be separately invoiced to the company, at cost.</dd>
